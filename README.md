A "Cube of light" project using panels full of WS2812B addressable LEDs, based on some ST MCU. 

Originally this thing was based on the Robotdyn Blackpill (stm32f303) but I bricked that board (RIP) and now i'm on a Nucleo-STM32L453, and the main folder in which the code resides is "L4_branch", though this will eventually change.
