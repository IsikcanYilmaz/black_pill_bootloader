A "Cube of light" project using panels full of WS2812B addressable LEDs, based on an STM32L453.

Current state of the project is:
 - LED panels glued and soldered into forming the 5 sides of the cube.
 - The panels work; STM devboard able to play animations and whatnot.
 - HW design should be done. Gotta order it
 
Need to do:
 - Order it, assemble it.
